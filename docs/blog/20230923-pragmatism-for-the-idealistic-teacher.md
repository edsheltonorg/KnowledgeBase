Wow! So much I've learned in the past few years. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<sup>...or perhaps lost due to **unnecessary idealism!**</sup>

Just today I was explaining to a beginner what a compiler was, and how C# used it.

> So C# is converted to CIL so it can be kind portable and it gets compiled twice so...

After getting a blank stare, I realized I had broken [the zone of proximal development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_of_proximal_development):

When teaching beginners, fully detailed answers <u>***are harmful!***</u> Here's a fun example:

<!-- more -->

Your inquisitive younger brother asks: ["What happens when you go to google.com?"](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when)

Most would give a phony "Oh, okay" and then never ask you again!<br>
<sup><sup>**Note:** My little brother is built different so this is a bad personal example.. but you get the point!</sup></sup>

Training others IT from zero experience should be handled like <u>planting a tree.</u>

- They have <u>some body of knowledge about something</u>, teach to their strengths!
- **The first few sessions are the ones that matter** and should be treated as such.
- Water & prune them only as needed, and watch them grow towards the sun of their spirit.

Remember how you <u>didn't call</u> Mrs. Krabappel when you calculated a tip last week?

Make fishermen out of your peers!

> ...Okay, how do we do that?

Well, let's take my C# compilation example:

The pragmatic explanation tells 0 lies and provides much better context.

Consider this war story:

Once upon a time, I *almost* blew up a project because I let slip it uses Docker!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**"...What?"** You may be asking.

Turns out, my boss thought it was a <u>death sentence dependency!</u>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**"...Why?"** You may be asking.

Turns out, a previous IT worker couldn't figure it out & told him it was unreliable!

Keep it simple, slow it down, and listen.<br>The more you speak the more you lose!
